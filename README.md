## Description
The objective of the project is to design and develop a microprocessor-controlled (MCU) prosthetic arm with a remote monitoring web app for below the elbow limb loss. The prosthetic arm and the associated web app should allow the user to access a wider range of mobility and improve their quality of life as well as being lightweight, cost-effective, and simple to use. 

The main design criteria are:
- Designing a lightweight and inexpensive prosthetic arm model that can be mass produced for children with upper limb-loss in developing countries
- Activating flexion of the prosthetic fingers in response to reaching an EMG stimulus threshold
- Displaying sensor data in a real-time format for the EMG and temperature sensors 
- Collecting and displaying historical 24-hour data for signal analysis
- Creating an accessible and simple web application that concisely conveys sensor and prosthetic arm usage information with low latency

## Special Notice
The web app is currently optimized for use on displays with widths of 1024px.
